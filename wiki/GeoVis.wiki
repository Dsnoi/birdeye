#summary GeoSpatial Analysis Components

=== Introduction ===

Rendering of vector-based maps with control and functions to facilitate analysis of geospatial data.

=== Status ===

Concept development (pre-Alpha): 19 March 2008

=== Explorer ===

A GeoVis Explorer is available [http://birdeye.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/examples/bin-debug/gvExplorer.html here]
to monitor the progress of the component.

=== Development Plan ===

*Phase I: Architecture and Base*
  * Logical architecture with a base US States and World Map vector dictionary;
    # US States – Census Regions and Sub Regions
    # World – Regions and Sub Regions
  * Multiple geographic projections
  * Features and Symbols
  * Events (featureClick, featureDoubleClick, featureRollOver, featureRollOut)
  * Styles (CSS styling of map objects and helper classes for RollOver, RollOut)
  * Controls  and Functions
    # Autofit (for map to display properly in container space)
    # Zoom and nearestNeighbor
    # Flow
    # Colorize
*Phase II:  Annotations and Surrounds*
  * Marker and Glyph objects (Bubble, map symbols, etc.)
  * Grids
  * Legend
  * Scale
*Phase III: 3D Rendering*
  * Plane based
  * Sphere based
  * 3D camera controls (pan, tilt, rotate, etc.)
*Phase IV: Coordinate Transforms*
  * Coordinate transforms for projections (Lat/Long)
  * Datums
*Phase V: GeoSpatial data readers*
  * ShapeFile
  * GML
  * KML
*Phase VI: Interface and Utility Classes*
  * Interface classes
  * Color Brewer
*Phase V: Tile and Raster Libs*
